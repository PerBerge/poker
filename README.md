I've made the input be on a one-line basis and using only space as delimiter instead of , 

The application can be built by running a maven build in the folder where the pom.xml resides.

mvn install 

The application can be executed by running the following command in the target folder:

java -jar poker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar Joe 3H 4H 5S 6H 8H Bob 3C 5D 4S 8C 10D Sally AC 10C 5C 2S 2C

Example of inputs:

Sally AC 10C 5C 2S 2C
Per AC JC QC KS 2C
Joe 2H 4H 5H 6H 8H
Bob 3C 3D 3S 8C 10D
